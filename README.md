## Description

A dedicated page for showcasing the basic information and the projects has done by Colin, the page including the following functions:
- an About me section introducing Colin
- a Project section listing all the projects Colin has done, and by clicking on the photo, viewer can get access to the deployed page.
- a Repo Link tap on the right bottom of each project, by clicking on it, viewer can get access to the repo of the deplyed page. (currently is not working properly due to the nested links issue, need to investigate further when JS is involved)
